Saluda Valley Valley Town Hall
Celebrating our 78th year

Our Mission

Saluda Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:

Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.

We hope you'll join us as we celebrate our 78th year of service to the Valley.
